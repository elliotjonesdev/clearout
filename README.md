## UX
### Project Goals
CLEAROUT is community based recycling appliction, with sustainability at the heart, encouraging users to recycle and reuse goods before thinking of throwing them away as waste. The primary goal of CLEAROUT is to help the user quickly list their multiple items in a short space of time without the need for creating long descriptions and uploading images that can often be time consuming. The key benefit to the user is to help declutter the home or work environment in an environmentally friendly way. The main project focus for the CLEAROUT app is to enable listing of less important items that may not require much additional information or even pictures, for example - "A4 picture frame, used and in good condition, white". Anyone viewing the item and interested in something for free can take an interest and make a further enquiries. The concept for CLEAROUT is to facilitate quick and easy transactions with minimal effort, and also to foster positive community ethos and connections.
