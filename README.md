## UX
### Project Goals
The primary goal of CLEAROUT is to help the user quickly list their multiple items for sale in a short space of time without the need for creating long descriptions and uploading images that can often be time consuming. CLEAROUT is community based, for the user listing and advertising to other app users in the local community, and encourages the user to list high quantity with ease to help declutter the home or workspace. The main project focus for the CLEAROUT app is to enable listing of less important items that may not require much additional information or even pictures as a means to a quick sale or giveaway for the user. For example - A4 picture frame, used and in good condition, £3.00. The concept for CLEAROUT is to facilitate quick and easy transactions with minimal effort.
